Project Title: Credit Scoring System for Loan Approval Using Machine Learning

Overview:
This project involves the development of a robust credit scoring system designed to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals applying for loans. Utilizing various machine learning techniques, the system aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of loan approval decisions.

Key Features:

Data Understanding: Analysis of a dataset with 17 columns and 4521 rows, including categorical and numerical variables.
Data Exploration and Engineering: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and addressed data imbalances using SMOTE.
Model Development: Implemented multiple machine learning models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Neural Networks, XGBoost, and more.
Model Optimization: Fine-tuned models to determine optimal parameters and enhance performance.
Model Comparison: Identified the Random Forest Classifier as the best model with high accuracy metrics (F1 Score of 0.95, AUC of 0.99, Accuracy of 0.95).
Outcome:
The project provides a reliable tool for credit risk assessment, improving the accuracy of loan approval decisions and aiding in better financial decision-making for lenders.
